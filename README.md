# VotingSystem-
Programming Fundamentals Project 
PROJECT REPORT

#Acknowledgment

We might want to communicate a profound feeling of thanks and
appreciation to our undertaking guides Sir Zain for managing us
immensely through the course of the task. He generally displayed a
keen interest in our work. His productive guidance and consistent
inspiration have been liable for the effective consummation of this task.
Our genuine gratitude goes to the lab teacher for his coordination in
broadening each conceivable help for the fulfillment of this task.


#INTRODUCTION
This projects aim is to create a simple but effective voting system which
will have two main users, an admin and multiple voters. The role and the
functions available to the users are as follow;

 ADMIN CONSOLE
- In this voting system project we have an admin console which
will be under control of the authority, admin can nominate
candidates, disqualify any candidate. Admin has the right to
determine the eligibility of ant candidate and then register them
in the voting system. Admin has the right to start and stop
voting procedures and can also monitor the current votes of any
candidate. In addition, no candidate would be able to cast
multiple votes. Admin have the right to suspend voting system
at anytime and system will automatically output the winner
having highest vote count. This system will prove to be hassle
free process of voting since no human handling and counting of
votes will be involved. There is a chance of rigging in elections
when human handling is involved. We can have a clean and
transparent election by using this system. A user name and
password is required to access the admin console

 VOTERS CONSOLE
- After registration, voters can caste their vote by selecting any
suitable candidate in the list by pressing the number against
their favorite candidate. Moreover the system favors voter with

anytime display of leading candidate and can view votes of
opponent candidate’s as well.
Voters can also check the leading candidate of the contest via
this system.

##5-Future Work

For future Improvements we would like to add two different consoles for
the voters and admin to make it look less cultured. Along with that we
would also like to make a GUI that would make the layout look better. A
database with all the unique ID number of the voters to be linked with
the code by a .txt file which will allow for the identification of the voter to
be checked and logged.
